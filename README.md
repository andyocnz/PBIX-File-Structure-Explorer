# Power BI Measure Cleanup Tool 

**A lightweight solution for managing measures in Power BI Live Connection models**

## The Problem

Working with large Power BI live connection models often leads to:
- **Hundreds of measures** scattered across tables (especially without proper best practices)
- **No clear organization** or documentation
- **Complex measure dependencies** that make deletions risky
- **Existing tools** like Tabular Editor work best with Import models and may have unnecessary complexity

## The Challenge

Safely cleaning measures isn't simple because:
-  **Dependency risks**: Measures might be referenced by other measures or visuals
-  **No undo functionality**: Critical measure removal can break reports irreversibly
-  **Limitations in free tools** for live connections
